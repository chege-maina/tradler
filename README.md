## About

This is a simple app to create users, list users, edit a specific user, delete a specific user and get a specific user. The app is built on Laravel framework as backend with a Vue Js user interface
frontend to test the API calls.

## Setup 

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.
